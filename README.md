# BiasedYesNo
Biased Yes No iOS Application

DESCRIPTION:
> Allows user to enter questions into the main View: YesNoMain, and this will call on a MySQL database hosted on a web server to provide a biased Yes-No response based on probabilities and statistics for the question.

> The general idea is that for every 10 friends you ask a yes/no question, maybe 7 will say 'yes' but '3' will say no. In this case the Biased Yes/No app will then be set with a probability of 70% (depending on the question) as opposed to just 50%.

> In time, the app is to take user input and use this to converge the biasedness to a general concensus.
